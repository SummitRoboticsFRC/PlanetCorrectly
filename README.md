# WhyAreMountainsSoFunny

A physicist, an engineer and a programmer were in a car driving over a steep alpine pass when the brakes failed. The car was getting faster and faster, they were struggling to get round the corners and once or twice only the feeble crash barrier saved them from crashing down the side of the mountain. They were sure they were all going to die, when suddenly they spotted an escape lane. They pulled into the escape lane, and came safely to a halt.

The physicist said, “We need to model the friction in the brake pads and the resultant temperature rise, see if we can work out why they failed.”

The engineer said, “I think I’ve got a few spanners in the back. I’ll take a look and see if I can work out what’s wrong.”

The programmer said, “Why don’t we get going again and see if it’s reproducible?”

Instructions for setting up your local dev environment: Follow Java Eclipse setup instructions here:

https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809/l/145002-installing-eclipse-c-java

In eclipse, select Window>Show View> Other > Git > Git Repositories

Select "Clone a Git Repository" In the URI field, fill in our repo url: https://github.com/SummitRoboticsFRC/WhyAreMountainsSoFunny

Click Next, Next again Make a note of the Directory that the repo is copied to.

By default it's /Users/yourname/git/WhyAreMountainsSoFunny. I recommend leaving it as is.

Now click finish. Now close Eclipse, reopen and set your workspace to the directory in step 6(Users/yourname/git/WhyAreMountainsSoFunny)

Now select File>New>Project>WPILib Robot Java Development > Robot Java Project Enter 1014 for the team number

For project name, put in BecauseTheyAreHillAreas. This is VERY IMPORTANT not to change the name, and capitalization matters, so just copy/paste this: BecauseTheyAreHillAreas

Select "Command-Based Robot" and click Finish.

Now you're ready to start programming!!!
