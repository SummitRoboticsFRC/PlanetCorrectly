Welcome to the Team 7707 robot code for 2019 Destination: Deep Space

How to install necessary software and libraries (this should work):

1. Install Visual Studio Code and the WPILib extension (containing necessary libraries) using the instructions here:
      http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/1027503-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc

2. Download a local copy of the repo
      Open Terminal
      Enter command "mkdir git" to create a folder named "git" in your home folder (ignore if already present)
      Enter command "cd git" to navigate to this directory
      Enter command "git clone https://github.com/SummitRoboticsFRC/PlanetCorrectly/" to clone a local copy of the repo
      Open VS Code and click the top icon on the left toolbar
      Click "Open Folder" and navigate to the project folder which is inside the downloaded repo (Celestial)
      You have now opened the project in VS Code (you must reopen if you close the window, but not if you quit directly)
   
3. Download and install the CTRE Phoenix Framework using the instructions here:
